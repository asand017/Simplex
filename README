I implemented the Simplex method in "Python"

To compile and run my program, use command: 'python main.py [input-file-name.txt]'

Simplex Method Result is printing into output file, 'simplex.out'

The simplex directory consists of "main.py", serval test input txt files, and "simplex.out" that holds the solution to the given LP.
